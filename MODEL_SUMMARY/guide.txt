HIERARCHY.txt outlines the defined model hierarchy and all defined variables in the model.
Each row is a variable (*) or model (|). If a variable is created in a model, it is indented under that model and lists (in order to the right)
the variable type (declared/registered output/created input), the promotion level, the shape, the promoted name, and the unpromoted name.

example:

    # Base model
    model = csdl.Model()

    # First level model
    model1 = csdl.Model()
    model.add(model1, 'ModelA', promotes = [])

    # Second level model
    model2 = csdl.Model()
    model2.create_input('x', val=3)
    model1.add(model2, 'ModelB', promotes = ['x'])
    # model1.declare_variable('x')

    # declare variable
    x = model.declare_variable('ModelA.x')
    model.register_output('y', x*2)

looks like:
| <SYSTEM LEVEL>
   *y                                                                                       out/./(1,)                         p:y 	(up:y)
   *ModelA.x                                                                                dec/./(1,)                         p:ModelA.x 	(up:ModelA.x)
   | ModelA
      | ModelB
         *x                                                                                 in /.10/(1,)                       p:ModelA.x 	(up:ModelA.ModelB.x)


We can see that the promoted name "ModelA.x" (right of 'p:') is listed twice, meaning they get promoted to the same variable.
